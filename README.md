I am relatively new to computer science. I have started the Harvard CS50 online course, but havent' taken the time to complete it yet. I will be starting the Epicodus coding bootcamp program this April.

The first language I learned was VBA (laughter acceptable), to write a little program in excel to track some data at the company I was working at at the time.

Then next one I learned was C, via CS50. Although, C was challenging and unforgiving at times, I ended up really enjoying the rigor and good habits it instilled in my programming from the beginning.

Next, I learned HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery by way of the Epicodus first chapter for the application. Right now, I am working on learning Ruby, exciting stuff!
